# Tarot

I created this as a proof of concept for an interactive Tarot card reading game. I *clearly* got this idea from the docs of [@react-spring](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-spring), but thought it would be a fun concept to build-out completely.

## Current Build Summary
At the moment, just an interactive card deck that lays out cards in a specific layout.

## Dev Milestones
 The deck component is fully and easily customizable with `draggable`, `flickable`, `flippable`, and a `layoutGrid`, allowing for easier future configuration. 

## Roadblocks
I **really** don't want to parse information for 72 different cards and their interpretations. Trying to figure out a way to automate this.
